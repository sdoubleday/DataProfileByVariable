Add this BIML file to an SSIS project in an IDE with BIDSHelper or another BIML processing engine and generate an SSIS package from it. That package runs the Data Profile task with seven profiles for a table specified in variables (ServerName, Database, TableSchema, TableName) and writes it to a directory you specify (with final "\" character). The output file will be named with all four parts of the table's qualified name and can be read with DataProfileViewer.exe. Sample dtexec.exe command in the BIML file. Please don't point the resultant package at production unless you know exactly what you are doing.
